# Some nano packages don't install a system-wide nanorc, leading to a rather
# impoverished experience.  Here's how to fix this:
#
# Linux: create /etc/nanorc with contents:
# include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"
#
# *BSD:
# On FreeBSD, create: /usr/local/etc/nanorc
# On OpenBSD, create: /etc/nanorc
# With contents: include "/usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc"
#
# MS-Windows (Chocolatey nano-win package):
# Create: C:\ProgramData\nanorc
# With contents:
# include "C:/ProgramData/chocolatey/lib/nano-win/tools/pkg_x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/nano/*.nanorc"
# Note that nano-win disables the spellchecker, so the "set speller" line above
# will need to be commented out.
